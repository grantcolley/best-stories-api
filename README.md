# Best Stories Api

**Best Stories Api** is a RESTful API to retrieve to retrieve the details of the best n stories from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), as determined by their score, where n is
specified by the caller to the API.

## Observations
I conducted a simple test, first calling the endpoint to fetch the IDs for best stories, followed by calling the endpoint to fetch each story. These steps were repeated with 5 seconds interval over a period of time.

I observed the `beststories` endpoint consistently returns 200 IDs, which appear to have been sorted by score in descending order. However, a story’s score is subject to change by the time the story has been fetched by calling the endpoint for individual stories, passing in the story’s id.

### Assumptions
- There is no way to subscribe to score changes in stories.
- Consumers of **Best Stories Api** will not be authenticated. The **Hacker News API** and so is **Best Stories Api**.
- There is [no rate limit](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#uri-and-versioning) on **Hacker News API** endpoints, so no need to "back off" periodically.

## How to run the application
The easiest was to run the application is clone the repository, open the solution in Visual Studio, compile it, and Start Debugging `F5`.

The default url is `https://localhost:7240`

Send a request to the API using [postman](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/readme-images/chrome_screenshot.png) or a browser, such as chrome e.g. `https://localhost:7240/getbeststories/200`

## If I had more time
- I would create a seperate API dedicated to running the Distributed Cache
- I would add more unit tests

## Implementation Details
### Minimal API
To retrieve the details of the best n stories from the Hacker News API, the consumer will call the `getbeststories` minimal API endpoint, specifying the number of stories required.

e.g. `https://localhost:7240/getbeststories/25`

```C#
app.MapGet("getbeststories/{count:int}", BestStoriesEndpoints.GetBestStories)
    .AddEndpointFilter<BestStoriesValidationFilter>();
```

### Caching the results
To efficiently service large numbers of requests without risking overloading of the **Hacker News API**, the results will be cached. 

Because of the indeterminate way each story’s score can be updated, after obtaining the IDs from the `beststories` endpoint, each story will be fetched.

When all the stories have been fetched, they will be sorted in descending order of score, before being persisted to cache.

A [BackgroundService](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api/Services/BestStoriesBackgroundService.cs) will be used to recycle the cache at a pre-configured interval.

Recycling the cache will involve building a new cache in the background then "swapping it out" with the existing cache.

The maximum cache size will be configurable using `CacheMaxSize`.

### Types of Caches
The cache implements [IBestStoriesCache](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api.Core/Interfaces/IBestStoriesCache.cs).
```C#
    public interface IBestStoriesCache
    {
        Task RecycleCacheAsync(IEnumerable<Story> stories);
        Task<IEnumerable<Story>?> GetStoryCacheAsync();
    }
```

#### Distributed Cache
For distributed caching, Distributed Memory Cache is used for development and testing purposes. In a production environment, the distributed cache should be hosted in a dedicated web API, and configured for the appropriate caching service e.g. Redis.

The current implementation for distributed caching is [DistributedCache](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api/Cache/DistributedCache.cs).

#### Local Cache
Local caching can be used if the web API is intended to run as a single application. There are a few flavours to choose from.
- **[LockedCache](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api/Cache/LockedCache.cs)** uses the lock keyword for recycling and getting a copy of the reference to the cache.
- **[SemaphoreSlimCache](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api/Cache/SemaphoreSlimCache.cs)** uses `await _semaphore.WaitAsync()`
- **[VolatileCache](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/BestStories.Api/Cache/VolatileCache.cs)** uses `Interlocked.CompareExchange` for recycling the cache and `Volatile.Read` for getting a copy of the reference to the cache. See inline comments for more details.

```

### Validation
An [endpoint filter](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/tree/main/src/BestStories.Api/Filters) will validate consumers provide a valid number between 1 and the specified `CacheMaxSize`.

### Configuration
The [appsettings.json](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/src/appsettings.json) contains the following:

|Key|Description|
|---|-----------|
|HackerNewsApi|HackerNewsApi url|
|CacheMaxSize|Maximum stories to be cached|
|CacheRecycleDelay|The delay between each cache recycle in milliseconds|
|CacheRetryDelay|The delay between each attempt to read the cache if it is null|
|CacheMaxRetryAttempts|Number of attempts to read the cache if it is null before giving up|
|IsDistributedCache|Flag to indicate wether to set up distributed or local caching at startup|

```C#
  "BestStoriesConfiguration": {
    "HackerNewsApi": "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/",
    "CacheMaxSize": 200,
    "CacheRecycleDelay": 5000,
    "CacheRetryDelay": 500,
    "CacheMaxRetryAttempts": 5,
    "IsDistributedCache": true
  }
```

## Testing
### Unit Tests 
[BestStoriesApi.Tests](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/tree/main/tests/BestStories.Api.Tests) contains the unit tests.

### Benchmarks
[BestStories.Api.Benchmarks](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/tests/BestStories.Api.Benchmarks/Program.cs) contains the benchmark test.

### Test Harness
[BestStoriesApi.Test.Harness](https://github.com/grantcolley/best-stories-api/blob/main/tests/BestStories.Api.Test.Harness/Program.cs) console application executes 1000 requests in 10 batches of 100 simultaneous requests. The number of batches, requests per batch and url can be changed. Run the *BestStoriesApi.Test.Harness.exe* from the output folder after the "Best Stories Api" is running.

>  **Warning**
>
> BestStoriesApi.Test.Harness does not replace proper load/stress testing.
> 
> For proper [load/stress testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/load-tests) a recognised third party tool should be used.
